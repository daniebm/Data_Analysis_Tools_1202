Assignment 5

 
# YouTube Dataset Example

The YouTube Dataset project aims to show the 1000 main channels of the platform with the most subscribers, specifying the type of focus that the channel has, such as entertainment, music, games, etc., for which Python will be used as a tool to be able to make these filters.

## Getting Started

To be able to visualize the steps carried out in python it is important to have the corresponding tools installed.
For this case, the Anaconda platform must be downloaded, from where we will access the Python environment and be able to view the code step by step.

### Prerequisites

It is important to have installed the following Packages:
1. Python
2. Anacoonda
   2.1 Jupiter Notebook


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
